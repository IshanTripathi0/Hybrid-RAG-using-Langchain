# Hybrid-RAG-using-Langchain
Hybrid RAG refers to an advanced retrieval technique that combines vector similarity search with traditional search methods, such as full-text search or BM25. This approach enables more comprehensive and flexible information retrieval by leveraging the strengths of both methods, vector similarity for semantic understanding and traditional techniques for precise keyword or text-based matching.

# Usage
``` bash
git clone
